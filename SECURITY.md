## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | :white_check_mark: |

This project follows a rolling release model. The `main` branch is supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.
2. Email the maintainers or use GitHub Security Advisories if available.
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt and aim to respond within a reasonable timeframe.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication

- **Open WebUI:** The default `WEBUI_AUTH=False` disables login. This is intended for **local/single-user** use only. If you expose the stack to a network (e.g., via port forwarding or LAN access), **enable authentication** by setting `WEBUI_AUTH=True` in the environment.
- **Dashboard / ops-controller:** Set `DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN` and `OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN` (generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`) whenever the stack is reachable beyond localhost.
- **n8n:** No built-in auth by default. If port **5678** is reachable from others (LAN, port-forward, Tailscale), enable n8n authentication (Basic Auth or full user management in n8n settings) or restrict access with a firewall / reverse proxy. Prefer not exposing n8n to the public internet without TLS and auth.

### Network Binding

Services bind to `0.0.0.0` to allow access from other machines on your network. Use a firewall to restrict access if needed.

### Secrets

- **Never commit** `.env` or `mcp/.env`. They are gitignored.
- Use `.env.example` as a template; copy to `.env` and fill in values locally.
- API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) and tokens should only live in `.env` files, never in the repository.
- **Never commit** `data/` — it is gitignored and contains user-specific runtime state (Hermes session data, Discord guild/user IDs, MCP config, etc.). All secrets and setup-specific values belong in `data/` or `.env`, not in shared code.

### Data

All runtime data is stored under `BASE_PATH/data/` via bind mounts. Ensure appropriate filesystem permissions and backups. The `data/` directory is gitignored and must remain untracked.

## Pre-deployment checklist

- [ ] `OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN` set (generate: `openssl rand -hex 32`)
- [ ] `.env` not committed (in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] Ops controller port (9000) not exposed to host/network
- [ ] Dashboard bound to localhost or Tailscale-only when multi-user

## Threat mitigations

| Threat | Check |
|--------|-------|
| docker.sock exposure | Only ops-controller and mcp-gateway mount it; dashboard does not |
| Controller compromise | Token in env; no default; never expose port |
| MCP SSRF (browser worker) | Egress blocks for 100.64/10, RFC1918, 169.254.169.254 — `./scripts/ssrf-egress-block.sh --target all` |
| Secret exfiltration (general) | Controller-only API keys; dashboard `/api/services` strips tokens from returned URLs |
| Unauthenticated admin | Set `DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN` for Tailscale/group use |

## Audit

- [ ] Audit log path writable: `data/ops-controller/`

## Break-glass

1. **Reset OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN:** Generate new token, update `.env`, restart dashboard + ops-controller
2. **Restore data:** Restore `data/` from a local backup
3. **Disable MCP tools:** Clear `data/mcp/servers.txt` or set to a single safe server
4. **Safe mode:** Stop `mcp-gateway` and `hermes-gateway`; use `ollama` + `open-webui` only
