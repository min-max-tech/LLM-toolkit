# Ordo AI Stack — Product Requirements Document

**Status:** Living document — updated 2026-03-28
**Scope:** Local-first AI platform: unified model access, shared tools, secure ops, RAG, and agentic runtime.

---

## Product Vision

A self-hosted AI platform that any developer can run with `./compose up -d`. Core guarantees:

1. **One model endpoint** — Every service reaches every model (Ollama, vLLM, future) via a single OpenAI-compatible gateway. No per-service provider config.
2. **Shared tools with health** — MCP tools served from a central gateway with registry metadata, per-server health badges, and policy controls.
3. **Authenticated ops** — Dashboard manages the full service lifecycle through a secure, audited control plane. No docker.sock in the UI layer.
4. **RAG out of the box** — Vector search (Qdrant) is wired into Open WebUI and exposed to the gateway; document ingestion is one compose profile away.
5. **Hardened by default** — Non-root containers, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, read-only filesystems, explicit networks, log rotation, resource limits across all custom services.

## Open Risks

| Risk | Severity | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| `docker.sock` in both `mcp-gateway` and `ops-controller` | High | Accepted — mitigated by allowlist + auth + no host port |
| `WEBUI_AUTH` still defaults to `False` | Medium | Tracked — change to `True` in M6 |
| MCP per-client policy (`allow_clients`) not enforced at gateway level | Medium | Planned — requires Docker MCP Gateway `X-Client-ID` support |
| No CI pipeline for compose smoke tests | Low | Tracked — M6 |
| Reliability / readiness contracts | High | Strategic — see [reliability-and-contracts.md](reliability-and-contracts.md) |

## Strategic Priority: Reliability Layer

The platform's next major quality bar is a **reliability spine**: guarantees that agent and tool clients can **reach, authenticate to, and recover from failures** across the shared stack—especially **Model Gateway `:11435`**, **MCP Gateway `:8811`**, and **browser/tool bridges** behind them.

**Design stance:** Any given agent (today: Hermes) is **one client** on a **shared service mesh**, not the architectural center. Service-to-service reliability and dependency management are the dominant failure mode when weak.

See [Reliability & Service Contracts](reliability-and-contracts.md) for full details.
