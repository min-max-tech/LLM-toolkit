# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased]

### Security

- **Timing-safe token comparison:** Auth token verification in dashboard and ops-controller now uses `hmac.compare_digest()` instead of `==`, preventing timing side-channel attacks.

- **LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS injection prevention:** `POST /env/set` now validates `LLAMACPP_EXTRA_ARGS` values with a strict character allowlist, preventing shell injection via backtick/subshell syntax when the value is word-split in run scripts.

- **Hardened CSP headers:** Added `connect-src 'self'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`, and `form-action 'self'` directives to Content-Security-Policy.

- **XSS fix in service cards:** Service hint text was injected as raw HTML; now uses `escapeHtml()`.

- **SSRF protection on outbox webhooks:** `publish_enqueue` endpoint now validates webhook URLs against private/reserved IP ranges using `ipaddress` module, preventing SSRF via crafted callback URLs.

- **Non-root ops-controller container:** ops-controller Dockerfile now runs as `appuser` (UID 1000) with docker group access instead of root.

- **Failed-auth logging:** Dashboard and ops-controller now log `AUTH_FAIL` warnings with path, method, and source IP on every rejected authentication attempt, enabling brute-force detection.

- **Audit log value masking:** `env_set` audit entries now log `len=N` instead of the first 80 chars of the value, preventing credential leakage if token-type keys are ever added to the env allowlist.

- **TruffleHog CI pinning:** Secret scanning action pinned from mutable `@main` to release tag `@v3.88.26`, preventing supply-chain attacks via compromised upstream commits.

- **ca-certificates preserved in ops-controller:** `apt-mark manual ca-certificates` prevents auto-removal when curl is purged, ensuring Python HTTPS calls work at runtime.

### Fixed

- **`ttft_ms` always zero in service-usage:** `/api/throughput/service-usage` was building per-service dicts without `ttft_ms`, so the `last_ttft_ms` stat always reported `0.0`. Now correctly propagated from the raw samples.

- **Worker retry race condition:** Retry job creation used `list_jobs(limit=1)` to find the new job by `retried_from` — with concurrency >1, a different job could occupy the slot, leaving `retry_count=0` and enabling unlimited retries. Now uses `create_job()` return value directly.

- **Dead `:path` route modifier:** `DELETE /api/comfyui/models/{category}/{filename:path}` declared `:path` (allows slashes) but immediately rejected any filename containing `/`. Changed to plain `{filename}`.

- **VACUUM blocks readers under load:** `vacuum_db()` ran with 30s busy_timeout, blocking all dashboard reads during the full rewrite. Now uses 5s timeout and logs a debug message on skip. Worker also skips vacuum when jobs are in-flight.

- **Worker retry crash protection:** If retry logic itself fails (e.g. corrupted compiled_workflow), the failure handler now catches the inner exception and marks the original job as failed instead of crashing the worker thread.

- **OPENCLAW_CONTEXT_WINDOW validation:** Invalid values now log a warning instead of silently falling back, making misconfigurations visible in logs.

- **Workflow version collision:** `save_workflow_version` and `rollback_workflow` used non-atomic SELECT MAX + INSERT for version numbers, allowing collisions under concurrent saves. Now uses atomic `INSERT…SELECT` with `COALESCE`.

- **Throughput state corruption on crash:** `_save_throughput_state()` wrote directly to `throughput.json`; a crash mid-write produced truncated JSON, losing all historical data on next load. Now uses atomic write-then-rename.

- **Job state machine enforcement:** `update_job` now validates state transitions against a defined state machine, preventing invalid regressions (e.g. `published -> queued`). Invalid transitions are logged and silently ignored.

- **Docker client leak in ops-controller:** `_docker_client()` created a new Docker SDK client (and HTTP connection pool) on every API call. Now caches a singleton, preventing file descriptor exhaustion under load.

- **Worker cancellation during ComfyUI polling:** `_comfyui_wait_outputs` now checks job state each poll iteration, allowing cancellation to take effect within 3 seconds instead of waiting up to 600 seconds for the full timeout.

- **Model switch partial failure visibility:** `set_active_model` now tracks per-step errors and returns `{"ok": false, "errors": [...]}` when downstream steps (open-webui recreate, openclaw restart) fail, instead of always returning `{"ok": true}`.

- **Ollama pull loop deadline:** `_run_ollama_pull` had an unbounded `while True` polling loop; now enforces a 2-hour deadline and aborts after 20 consecutive poll errors.

- **ComfyUI pull loop deadline:** `_run_comfyui_pull` had the same unbounded polling pattern; now enforces a 2-hour deadline and aborts after 20 consecutive poll failures.

- **Service recreate timeout:** `subprocess.run` in ops-controller `service_recreate` now has a 120-second timeout, preventing indefinite hangs if `docker-compose up` stalls. Returns HTTP 504 on timeout.

- **TOCTOU race in `update_job` state validation:** State transition guard read the current state in a separate connection from the write, allowing a concurrent thread to change the state between check and update. Now uses a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE state IN (valid_sources)` in a single atomic query.

- **Outbox stats inconsistent snapshot:** `get_outbox_stats` ran two independent COUNT queries; rows could change between them. Now uses a single query with `SUM(CASE ...)`.

- **Outbox attempt counter race:** `record_outbox_attempt` read the attempt count and incremented in Python, allowing concurrent calls to read the same value. Now performs the read and update within the same connection/transaction.

- **`cancel_job` re-read via separate connection:** After updating the job state, `cancel_job` called `get_job()` which opened a new connection, potentially returning stale data. Now returns the row from the same connection.

- **Ops-controller health endpoint was a no-op:** `/health` returned `{"ok": true}` unconditionally without checking Docker daemon connectivity. Now pings Docker and returns 503 if unreachable.

- **Stale Docker client cached forever:** If the Docker daemon restarted, the cached client would fail on every subsequent call. Now validates the connection with `ping()` and reconnects on failure.

- **Silent GGUF model scan failure:** `_scan_gguf_models` swallowed `OSError` silently, masking disk/mount failures. Now logs a warning.

- **Model deletion missing audit trail:** `ollama_delete` permanently removed model files without any log entry. Now logs `MODEL_DELETED` with model name and path.

- **Worker creates new TCP connection per ComfyUI poll:** `_comfyui_post_prompt` and `_comfyui_wait_outputs` used bare `httpx.post()`/`httpx.get()`, creating a new connection each call. Now reuses a module-level `httpx.Client` with connection pooling.

- **`_fetch_ollama_library` blocks async event loop:** Synchronous `urllib.request.urlopen` with 15s timeout ran directly in an `async def` route, blocking all other requests. Now wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread`.

- **Ollama library cache race condition:** `_ollama_library_cache` and `_ollama_library_ts` were read/written from both background threads and async handlers without synchronization. Now guarded by `_state_lock`.

- **ComfyUI models.json opened without encoding:** `open(config_path)` used platform-default encoding. Now explicit `encoding="utf-8"`.

- **ComfyUI model delete returns 500 for permission errors:** `PermissionError` is now caught separately and returns HTTP 403 instead of 500.

- **Ops-controller `/services` swallows Docker errors as 200:** Docker failures returned `{"services": [], "error": "..."}` with HTTP 200. Now returns HTTP 503 with `detail` field.

- **OpenClaw startup path error:** TOOLS.md Session Startup used relative paths (`TOOLS.md`) which less capable models resolved as `/app/TOOLS.md` instead of the workspace directory. Now uses absolute `/home/node/.openclaw/workspace/` paths.

- **Unbounded throughput model-key growth:** `_throughput_samples` and `_ttft_samples` capped samples per model but not the number of distinct models, allowing memory exhaustion via unique model names. Now capped at 50 tracked models.

- **Uncapped `limit` on list_jobs endpoint:** `/api/orchestration/jobs?limit=999999999` could force SQLite to materialize an enormous result set. Now clamped to `max(1, min(limit, 1000))`.

- **Throughput record missing field constraints:** `ThroughputRecordRequest` accepted arbitrary-length model names, negative values, `inf`, and `nan`. Now uses Pydantic `Field` with `max_length`, `ge`, and `le` constraints.

- **ComfyUI history response type validation:** Worker accepted any JSON shape from ComfyUI history endpoint; a non-dict entry would silently poll until timeout. Now validates entry is a dict and logs a warning.

- **Unbounded error strings in job database:** Exception messages from ComfyUI could be arbitrarily large, bloating the SQLite database. Error strings now truncated to 4096 characters before storage.

- **Audit log injection via X-Request-ID:** Raw `X-Request-ID` header was written directly into the JSON audit log, allowing injection of fake fields or broken log parsing. Now sanitized to alphanumeric/dashes, capped at 128 chars.

- **Information disclosure in unauthenticated health/services endpoints:** Docker exception strings (containing hostnames, socket paths, version info) were returned to unauthenticated clients. Now returns generic "Docker unavailable" message; details logged server-side only.

- **`cancel_job` ignored running jobs:** Only `queued` and `validated` jobs could be cancelled, even though the state machine and worker already supported `running -> cancelling`. Now includes `running` in the cancellable states.

- **Benchmark throughput inflated by network overhead:** `output_tokens_per_sec` was calculated from wall-clock time including HTTP round-trip. Now prefers server-reported `timings.predicted_per_second` from llama.cpp when available, falling back to wall-clock calculation.

- **ComfyUI pull polling dies silently on connection loss:** The frontend poll loop had no `.catch()`, causing the button to stay disabled forever if the backend restarted during a download. Now retries up to 20 times before showing a connection-lost message.

- **Service stop/restart missing confirmation:** Stop and restart buttons fired immediately without a `confirm()` prompt, risking accidental service disruption. Now matches the existing pattern for model deletion and active model switching.

- **Cron expression validation missing on schedule update:** `update_schedule` accepted arbitrary cron strings without validation, causing `croniter` to raise at evaluation time. Now validated on save with a 400 response for malformed expressions.

- **Path traversal in ComfyUI node requirements install:** `comfyui_install_node_requirements_api` accepted `..` segments and absolute paths in `node_path`, allowing reads/writes outside the custom nodes directory. Now rejects paths containing `..` or starting with `/`.

- **No validation on `state` query parameter in `list_jobs`:** `GET /api/orchestration/jobs?state=bogus` passed raw strings to the query, producing empty results instead of an error. Now validates against `JobState` enum, returning 400 for unknown states.

- **ComfyUI models scan blocks async event loop:** `_scan_comfyui_models()` performs synchronous filesystem I/O directly in an async route handler, blocking all concurrent requests. Now wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread`.

- **Throughput save on every record call:** `_save_throughput_state()` wrote to disk on every `/api/throughput/record` call, causing unnecessary I/O under high request volume. Now debounced to write at most every 5 seconds via `_maybe_save_throughput()`.

- **SSRF check was a no-op:** `publish_enqueue` detected private IPs in webhook URLs but executed `pass` instead of raising an exception, silently allowing all private-IP webhooks through. Now raises HTTP 400.

- **Blocking DNS lookup in async handler:** `socket.getaddrinfo()` in `publish_enqueue` blocked the event loop during DNS resolution. Now wrapped with `asyncio.to_thread`.

- **Popen without timeout in model pull:** `_run_model_pull` and `_run_gguf_pull` used `proc.wait()` with no timeout; a hung child process would block the pull thread forever. Now uses `proc.wait(timeout=7200)` with `proc.kill()` on timeout.

- **Worker outbox creates new connection per delivery:** `process_outbox()` used bare `httpx.post()` (throwaway client) every 0.5s poll cycle, churning TCP connections. Now reuses a module-level `httpx.Client`.

- **Redundant validated state update in worker:** `execute_job` called `update_job(state=validated)` even though `claim_next_job` already set the state to `validated`, wasting a DB write on every job.

- **`list_outputs` calls `stat()` three times per file:** Sorting, size, and mtime each triggered a separate `stat()` syscall. Now caches the stat result once per file.

- **`update_schedule` re-reads via separate connection:** After UPDATE, `update_schedule` called `get_schedule()` which opened a new connection, potentially returning stale data. Now returns the row from the same connection.

- **Missing index on `workflow_versions.promoted_at`:** `get_promoted_workflow` filtered on `promoted_at IS NOT NULL` without a covering index, forcing a scan of all versions per workflow. Added partial index on `(workflow_id, version DESC) WHERE promoted_at IS NOT NULL`.

- **SSRF bypass via operator precedence:** The SSRF allowlist condition had a Python precedence bug: `and` bound tighter than `or`, causing any dotless hostname (e.g. `http://metadata/`) resolving to a private IP to bypass the check. Fixed parenthesization to correctly scope the Docker hostname exception.

- **Double `stat()` in GGUF model scan:** `_scan_gguf_models` called `p.stat()` twice per file (size + mtime). Now caches the result.

- **Outbox processing runs every poll tick:** `process_outbox()` ran every 0.5s unconditionally, opening a DB connection each time even when no entries existed. Now gated by a 5-second interval (`OUTBOX_CHECK_SEC`).

- **Audit log reads entire file into memory:** `GET /audit` loaded the full audit log (up to 10 MB) via `read_text()` on every request. Now uses `deque(f, maxlen=limit)` to read only the last N lines.

- **Vacuum future silently lost:** `pool.submit(vacuum_db)` discarded the returned future; unexpected exceptions were silently swallowed. Now logs errors via `add_done_callback`.

- **ComfyUI model delete missing audit trail:** `DELETE /api/comfyui/models/{category}/{filename}` performed destructive file deletion with no log entry. Now logs `MODEL_DELETED` with category, filename, and path.

- **MCP server add/remove missing audit trail:** `POST /api/mcp/add` and `POST /api/mcp/remove` modified gateway configuration with no log entry. Now logs `MCP_SERVER_ADDED` and `MCP_SERVER_REMOVED` with the server name.

- **TTFT samples bypass `_MAX_TRACKED_MODELS` cap:** `_ttft_samples` dict grew unboundedly with unique model names even though `_throughput_samples` was capped at 50 keys. Now both dicts share the same cap.

- **Benchmark endpoint bypasses model-key cap:** `/api/throughput/benchmark` inserted into `_throughput_samples` without checking `_MAX_TRACKED_MODELS`, allowing unbounded growth via arbitrary model names. Now guarded.

- **Concurrent model switch race condition:** Two simultaneous `POST /api/active-model` calls could interleave `.env` writes and service restarts, leaving services pointing at different models. Now guarded by an `asyncio.Lock`, returning 409 if a switch is already in progress.

- **Throughput state file encoding mismatch:** `_load_throughput_state` used platform-default encoding while model names may contain non-ASCII characters, causing decode errors on Windows. Now explicit `encoding="utf-8"` on both read and write.

- **Cron expression not validated on schedule creation:** `POST /api/orchestration/schedules` accepted arbitrary cron strings without validation (only `PATCH` validated). Invalid expressions were silently persisted with `next_run=None`. Now validated before creation, returning 400.

- **KeyError crash in benchmark when model cap reached:** `/api/throughput/benchmark` hit a `KeyError` when `_throughput_samples` was at the 50-model cap: the trim-samples line ran unconditionally outside the `if model in` guard. Now properly nested.

- **`update_schedule` preserves stale `next_run_at` on cron change:** Updating a schedule's `cron_expr` via PATCH kept the old `next_run_at`, causing the first fire to use the old timing. Now recomputes `next_run_at` from the new expression.

- **`_write_json_async` not crash-safe:** OpenClaw config and other JSON files were written via `path.write_text()` directly; a crash mid-write would leave truncated JSON. Now uses atomic write-then-rename (matching the throughput state pattern).

- **`list_jobs` limit unsanitized in DB layer:** The routes layer clamped limits, but direct callers of `list_jobs` could pass negative or extreme values. Now clamped to `max(1, min(limit, 1000))` in the DB function itself.

- **Popup-blocked crash in logs viewer:** `window.open` returns `null` when popups are blocked; the next line threw `TypeError` on `win.document.write`. Now checks for null and shows a toast message.

- **Worker `_resolve_workflow_path` missing empty-safe guard:** Workflow IDs consisting entirely of filtered characters (e.g. `"..."`) produced `safe=""`, resolving to `root/.json`. Now returns `None` (matching the dashboard version).

- **`.gguf` filename yields empty `bare_name` in model switch:** `set_active_model` accepted `.gguf` as a valid filename, producing an empty model ID passed to downstream services. Now rejected with 400.

- **ComfyUI history poll uses fixed 3s interval:** `_comfyui_wait_outputs` polled every 3 seconds regardless of render duration, generating ~200 requests over 600s. Now uses exponential backoff (3s → 15s cap).

- **Ollama pull poll retries forever on error:** Frontend `pollOllamaPull` had no error counter; a persistent server error caused infinite 2s polling. Now caps at 20 consecutive errors.

- **Hub model download poll aborts on first error:** A single transient failure stopped polling and left the UI in an indeterminate state. Now retries up to 20 times before giving up.

- **ComfyUI resume poll has no error handling:** `resumeActivePulls` poll chain had no `.catch()`, causing the UI to freeze if a network error occurred. Now handles errors with a 20-retry cap.

### Added

- **Test coverage expansion (session 4):** Added 3 tests: state transition rejection (published cannot transition to running), cancelled-is-terminal invariant, and `_resolve_workflow_under_root` path traversal prevention (6 attack vectors). Total: 223 tests.

- **Global exception handler:** Unhandled exceptions in API endpoints now return `{"detail": "Internal server error"}` instead of raw Python tracebacks with internal paths and variable values. Full traceback is logged server-side.

- **Test coverage expansion (session 2):** Added 10 new tests covering `/api/services`, `/api/ollama/library`, `/api/throughput/record` (3 cases), `/api/throughput/stats`, `/api/throughput/service-usage`, `/api/auth/config`, and global exception handler (total: 220 tests).

- **GPU Compute Pressure dashboard section:** New `#compute-pressure` section shows per-service VRAM allocation (stacked bar), live process rows, and LLM throughput degradation score. Backend: `GET /api/hardware/gpu-processes` (pynvml + psutil with `pid: host`). Frontend: 3-second polling, color-coded service segments, degradation thresholds (≥85% nominal, 60–84% degraded, <60% starved).

- **SSRF protection on model downloads:** `POST /models/download` now validates URLs against a domain allowlist (HuggingFace, Civitai, GitHub) and blocks private/reserved IP ranges. Prevents server-side request forgery via crafted model URLs.

- **Worker graceful shutdown:** Worker process now handles SIGTERM/SIGINT, drains in-flight jobs (120s timeout), and exits cleanly. Prevents job corruption when Docker stops the container.

- **Test coverage expansion:** Added 88 new tests across 7 test files: ops-controller auth enforcement (26 tests), dashboard auth middleware (18 tests), text sanitizers (16 tests), orchestration outbox/callback (10 tests), ComfyUI API client (9 tests), SSRF validation (5 tests), and model download URL blocking.

### Accessibility

- **WCAG AA contrast fix:** `--muted` color bumped from `#6e7694` to `#8a90a8` (~5.1:1 ratio against `--bg`), clearing the 4.5:1 AA minimum for normal text across ~40 dashboard elements.

- **Keyboard focus visibility:** All `input:focus` rules changed to `focus-visible` pattern — keyboard users see a clear outline ring, mouse users get clean styling. Fixes WCAG 2.4.7.

- **Reduced-motion support:** Added `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` that disables animations, transitions, and smooth scroll for users with vestibular disorders. Fixes WCAG 2.3.3.

- **Hardware staleness indicator:** Hardware metrics section fades to 50% opacity and shows a tooltip when the last successful poll is older than 15 seconds, making connectivity loss visible instead of silently showing stale data.

### Changed

- **Parallel service and dependency probes:** `/api/services`, `/api/health`, and `/api/dependencies` now run all HTTP probes concurrently via `asyncio.gather()` instead of sequentially. Dependency probes converted from synchronous httpx to async. All probes reuse the shared connection-pooled HTTP client.

- **Model Gateway health probe:** Changed from `/health` (returns 401, requires auth) to `/health/liveliness` (unauthenticated) in both `dependency_registry.json` and `services_catalog.py`. Removed stale `ready_url` (`/ready` returned 404). Updated description text.

- **comfyui-mcp healthcheck:** Changed from HTTP GET to `/mcp` (returned 406 and terminated the MCP server) to a TCP socket check on port 9000.

- **Pull endpoint race condition fix:** `/api/ollama/pull` and `/api/comfyui/pull` set `running=True` while holding `_state_lock` before spawning the background thread, closing a TOCTOU race where concurrent requests could bypass the "already running" guard.

- **Improved error messages:** Ops-controller confirm messages now explain what the destructive operation does and the expected JSON shape. Orchestration workflow_id errors include format guidance. Auth error tells user to set the token in `.env`.

- **Orchestration endpoint error handling:** `/api/orchestration/workflows` and `/api/orchestration/outputs` wrapped in `try/except OSError` so filesystem failures return empty lists instead of 500 tracebacks.

- **SQLite durability:** Orchestration DB now uses `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` (was implicit default `FULL` on non-WAL, but `NORMAL` is recommended for WAL mode) and increased `busy_timeout` from 10s to 30s for better contention handling.

- **Worker shutdown WAL checkpoint:** Worker now runs a final `checkpoint_wal()` after draining in-flight jobs during shutdown, ensuring all writes are flushed to the main DB file before exit.

- **Dashboard WCAG AA contrast:** `--muted` color bumped from `#4d5468` (2.73:1 contrast ratio) to `#6e7694` (4.60:1) to pass WCAG AA minimum of 4.5:1 for normal text on dark backgrounds.

- **Auth modal accessibility:** Added Escape key to close, focus trap cycling between input and button, and keyboard event handling.

- **Dashboard UI polish:** Dependencies table simplified (removed empty Ready/OpenClaw columns, added Latency column). Logs viewer popup themed to match dashboard. Toasts now click-to-dismiss (5s auto). Nav link "Throughput" renamed to "Telemetry" to match section heading. Ops button loading state uses opacity fade instead of spinning.

- **Frontend auth consistency:** `refreshHardware` and compute pressure used raw `fetch()` bypassing auth headers; switched to `api()` wrapper.

- **Async I/O performance:** Moved all synchronous file reads/writes in async dashboard handlers to `asyncio.to_thread()` via `_read_json_async`/`_write_json_async` helpers. Prevents event-loop blocking during OpenClaw config operations.

- **HTTP connection pooling:** Replaced 8 per-request `AsyncClient(timeout=...)` context managers with a persistent `httpx.AsyncClient` managed in the app lifespan. Eliminates TCP handshake overhead on every API call to model-gateway, ops-controller, Qdrant, and MCP gateway.

- **Worker poll interval:** Reduced default `WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` from 2s to 0.5s, cutting average job pickup latency by 75%.

- **Frontend polling efficiency:** Added `visibilitychange`-aware polling — all `setInterval` timers (3s compute pressure, 5s hardware, 15s refresh) pause when the tab is hidden and resume on focus. Added `debounce(200ms)` to model search input.

- **Exception handling tightened:** Replaced 17 bare `except Exception:` handlers across orchestration_db.py, rag-ingestion/ingest.py, comfyui-mcp, and orchestration-mcp with specific exception types (`json.JSONDecodeError`, `ValueError`, `OSError`, `ImportError`).

- **AGENTS.md compliance:** Added missing `from __future__ import annotations` to 11 Python files (tests, comfyui-mcp).

- **CI path filter:** Added `rag-ingestion/**` to orchestration-stack-e2E path-gated filter.

- **Docker hardening:** Worker, orchestration-mcp, and ops-controller Dockerfiles now run as non-root `appuser`. Worker Dockerfile upgraded from Python 3.11 to 3.12 for consistency. Added root `.dockerignore` to exclude `.git`, `data/`, `models/`, `.env` from build context (worker uses repo root as context).

- **Reproducible builds:** Pinned model-gateway base image from floating `:main-stable` to `:main-v1.65.5`. Pinned comfyui-mcp upstream clone to specific commit SHA.

- **CI pip caching:** All `setup-python` steps now use `cache: pip` with `cache-dependency-path`, saving 30-60s per CI run.

- **Worker healthcheck freshness:** Worker healthcheck now verifies heartbeat file age (<120s) instead of just file existence, so a deadlocked main loop triggers Docker restart.

- **Worker logging config:** Added `json-file` logging driver with 10MB rotation to worker service (was missing, unbounded logs could fill disk).

- **open-webui startup ordering:** `depends_on` now uses `condition: service_healthy` for llamacpp, model-gateway, and qdrant so open-webui waits for backends to be ready.

- **Dashboard connection pool:** Increased httpx `max_connections` from 20 to 100 to prevent request queuing when multiple browser tabs are open during streaming requests.

- **Frontend polling fix:** `stopPolling()` called before `startPolling()` on tab resume to prevent interval accumulation from rapid visibility changes.

- **Frontend refresh correctness:** `loadThroughputStats()`, `loadThroughputServiceUsage()`, and `loadPerfKPIs()` are now awaited in `refresh()` so the loading spinner stays visible until all data is loaded.

- **Exception handling:** Replaced bare `except Exception: pass/continue` patterns in ComfyUI queue polling (dashboard) and history polling (worker) with specific exception types and debug logging.

- **Hygiene:** Added `pytest-cache-files-*` and `tmp*` to `.gitignore`. Configured `tmp_path_retention_policy = "none"` in pyproject.toml to prevent temp directory buildup.

- **Docker health checks:** Added healthcheck directives for worker (heartbeat file) and comfyui-mcp (process liveness) in docker-compose.yml. Worker poll interval now configurable via `WORKER_POLL_INTERVAL_SEC` env var (default 0.5s).

- **Config validation:** Dashboard port settings (`OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_PORT`, etc.) now validated at startup with warnings for invalid values and browser-blocked IRC port range (6666-6669).

- **Work summary note - OpenClaw / Primus remediation work:** [`docs/openclaw-primus-work-summary-2026-04-05.md`](docs/openclaw-primus-work-summary-2026-04-05.md) summarizes the recent local work across bridge hardening, flat-tool defaults, dynamic ComfyUI workflow guidance, compaction/runtime investigation, transcript-aware recovery, status/continue reply rules, and the remaining unresolved failure classes.

- **Investigation note — Primus compaction/runtime failures:** [`docs/openclaw-primus-compaction-investigation-2026-04-05.md`](docs/openclaw-primus-compaction-investigation-2026-04-05.md) captures the recent Primus failure pattern with local evidence and external references: OpenClaw compaction/context docs, MCP tool-result sequencing requirements, analogous post-tool synthesis failures, contaminated compaction summaries, empty assistant replies, and the absence of new ComfyUI audio outputs.

- **OpenClaw / Primus remediation summary:** Recent local work now spans three coordinated areas: MCP bridge hardening for local models, a shift from built-in media templates toward dynamic ComfyUI workflow authoring, and runtime guidance/recovery changes aimed at post-tool and post-compaction stability. The new summary note documents the implemented scope and distinguishes the improved failure classes from the ones still unresolved.

- **OpenClaw media workflow model:** ComfyUI media tasks no longer assume built-in `generate_*` templates. Workspace guidance now treats ComfyUI as a general image/audio/video engine: reuse a saved workflow when it fits, otherwise inspect nodes, author or adapt a workflow, validate it, save it if useful, run it, await it, and fetch outputs.

- **OpenClaw MCP bridge defaults:** Generated OpenClaw plugin config now prefers direct `gateway__...` flat tools with `flatTools: true` and keeps `injectSchemas: false`. Workspace guidance was updated to steer agents toward direct workflow-authoring tools such as `gateway__list_workflows`, `gateway__search_nodes`, `gateway__validate_workflow`, `gateway__save_workflow`, `gateway__run_workflow`, `gateway__await_run`, and `gateway__list_outputs` instead of relying on proxy-only `gateway__call`.

- **Runtime bootstrap guidance:** The runtime `AGENTS.md` contract was shortened and tightened so the critical OpenClaw rules remain inside the bootstrap injection cap. It now explicitly covers prose-only `status` replies, safe `continue`/`resume` behavior, and ComfyUI workflow-authoring expectations without tripping the old truncation threshold.

### Fixed

- **OpenClaw post-compaction recovery:** The forked `openclaw-mcp-bridge` now derives recovery context directly from recent session JSONL during `before_prompt_build`. It detects contaminated compaction summaries, empty post-tool assistant turns, and recent raw workflow payloads so resumed turns prefer current structured state over polluted compacted prose.

- **OpenClaw `status` / `continue` reply contract:** Status-style prompts (`status`, `progress`, `update`) and continuation prompts (`continue`, `resume`, `go on`) now receive explicit prose-only reply guards in both workspace guidance and the plugin prompt contract. The model is told not to dump raw workflow JSON, not to repeat the last tool payload, not to end with an empty assistant message, and not to call `read` without an absolute `path`.

- **MCP proxy/tool-call hardening:** `openclaw-mcp-bridge` now strips a stray leading quote before `{`/`[` in malformed proxy args, keeps `tool` required in the proxy schema, and auto-discovers available tools when a proxy call omits `tool` instead of returning a dead-end error. This reduces repeated `missing required tool name` and `args JSON parse failed` loops in local model sessions.

- **OpenClaw runtime bootstrap pressure:** Runtime workspace guidance was shortened so the most important OpenClaw rules are more likely to survive bootstrap truncation. This reduces one source of degraded resumed turns in local-model sessions, even though empty assistant completions and task-path drift are still being observed in later transcripts.

- **Project identity:** Repository and stack renamed from **AI-toolkit** to **Ordo AI Stack** (technical slug **`ordo-ai-stack`**). Docker Compose **`name`**, image tags (**`ordo-ai-stack-*`**), explicit networks (**`ordo-ai-stack-frontend`** / **`ordo-ai-stack-backend`**), CLI entrypoints (**`./ordo-ai-stack`**, **`.\ordo-ai-stack.ps1`**, **`.\ordo-ai-stack.cmd`**), and **`ORDO_AI_STACK_ROOT`** ( **`scripts/validate_openclaw_config.py`** still accepts **`AI_TOOLKIT_ROOT`** ) are updated. **Rebuild** images after pull: `docker compose build` or full init (`ordo-ai-stack initialize`). Old **`ai-toolkit*`** images/networks can be removed once containers are recreated.

- **ComfyUI (GPU):** **`COMFYUI_CLI_ARGS`** in **`.env`** drives **`CLI_ARGS`** (defaults: **`--normalvram`** for GPU **`overrides/compute.yml`**, **`--cpu`** for base compose). **`scripts/detect_hardware.py`** appends **`COMFYUI_CLI_ARGS=--disable-xformers --normalvram --enable-manager`** when missing on NVIDIA/AMD/Intel. Juno **`ltx-video`**: **ImageResizeKJv2** **`cpu` → `cuda`**. OOM: set **`--lowvram`** in **`COMFYUI_CLI_ARGS`** and **`docker compose restart comfyui`**.
- **ComfyUI container RAM cap (GPU):** **`comfyui_memory_limit()`** in **`scripts/detect_hardware.py`** now targets **~42%** of host RAM (floor **32G**, cap **96G**) instead of **25%** / **48G** max — avoids Linux **OOM killer** (**`Killed`** in **`docker logs`** after **`Requested to load VideoVAE`**) on LTX workflows. Override with **`COMFYUI_MEMORY_LIMIT`** in **`.env`**.
- **ComfyUI / LTX Gemma `cudaErrorInvalidValue`:** NVIDIA **`overrides/compute.yml`** — **`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`** is **`${PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF:-expandable_segments:True,pinned_use_cuda_host_register:True}`** so **`.env`** can set **`PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True`** (omit pinned) when **`sd1_clip.py`** / **`lt.py`** fails on **`torch.cat(...).to(intermediate_device())`**. **TROUBLESHOOTING** documents **`--gpu-only`** as an alternative.

- **MCP gateway — ComfyUI missing from `tools/list`:** With **`--servers`** set, the gateway merges **catalog** files for MCP server definitions and does **not** apply **`--additional-registry`** (registry.yaml) for that purpose. **`gateway-wrapper.sh`** now passes **`registry-custom.docker.yaml`** as **`--additional-catalog`**. The fragment uses the catalog top-level key **`registry:`** (not **`servers:`**) and a proper **`comfyui`** entry (**`type`**, **`title`**, **`description`**, **`env`**). Tavily/DuckDuckGo overrides were removed from the custom file (online catalog + compose env).

- **OpenClaw workspace paths:** Runtime workspace root is the mount root — role docs are **`agents/<name>.md`** (e.g. **`agents/docker-ops.md`**), not **`workspace/agents/…`**. **`TOOLS.md`**, **`AGENTS.md`**, **`docker-ops.md`**, **TROUBLESHOOTING**, and **`.example`** templates updated so agents stop **`read`**/`ENOENT` on **`/app/agents/`** — addresses chat where **all** **`gateway__comfyui__*`** tools were missing and **`gateway__call`** JSON for **`comfyui__pull_comfyui_models`** was documented.

- **MCP gateway — `MCP_GATEWAY_VERBOSE`:** **`mcp/gateway/gateway-wrapper.sh`** passes **`--verbose`** to **`docker/mcp-gateway`** when **`MCP_GATEWAY_VERBOSE=1`**. **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** documents **`mcp-gateway` listing only 30 tools** when ComfyUI MCP never spawns — root cause of **`gateway__comfyui__*` Tool not found** in OpenClaw.

- **OpenClaw workspace — `docker-ops.md`:** Documents correct **ComfyUI model pull** MCP ids, **`COMFYUI_PACKS`** / **`comfyui-model-puller`**, **`gateway__call`** JSON, infra checklist when flat tools are missing, and that **`openclaw`** has no **`list-model-packs`** CLI. **`TOOLS.md`** and **TROUBLESHOOTING** include wrong/correct tool tables for LTX / ops issues.

- **ComfyUI-Manager (Docker):** Seed **`config/comfyui-manager-seed.ini`** into **`data/comfyui-storage/ComfyUI/user/__manager/config.ini`** on first **`ensure_dirs`** ( **`security_level = weak`**, **`network_mode = public`** ) so git installs, pip, and downloads work with **`--listen`**. Compose passes **`GITHUB_TOKEN`** from **`GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`**. **`ops-controller`** / host scripts use **`python3 -m pip`** for custom-node requirements.

- **Workspace — agentic patterns:** [`openclaw/workspace/agents/agentic-design-patterns.md`](openclaw/workspace/agents/agentic-design-patterns.md) maps [Mathews-Tom/Agentic-Design-Patterns](https://github.com/Mathews-Tom/Agentic-Design-Patterns) (tool use, MCP, memory, multi-agent) to OpenClaw + Ordo AI Stack; **`AGENTS.md`** links to it. Cron jobs must use a real **`gateway/…`** model in **`payload.model`**, not **`default`**.

- **OpenClaw built-in `browser` denied by default:** **`merge_gateway_config.py`** adds **`tools.deny: ["browser"]`** unless **`OPENCLAW_ALLOW_BUILTIN_BROWSER=1`**. Web research uses **[Tavily](https://app.tavily.com)** MCP (**`gateway__tavily__tavily_*`**) when **`TAVILY_API_KEY`** is set — not Playwright.

- **MCP Tavily (replaces Playwright):** **`registry-custom.yaml`** registers **`mcp/tavily`** with **`TAVILY_API_KEY`** injected from root **`.env`** (see **`gateway-wrapper.sh`**). Default **`servers.txt`** / **`MCP_GATEWAY_SERVERS`**: **`duckduckgo,n8n,tavily,comfyui`**. Removed **`mcp/playwright`** image build and **`playwright-mcp-image`** compose service.

- **Model Gateway:** `GET /v1/models` no longer lists each Ollama model twice (`name` and `ollama/name`). Only the canonical id is returned (same id the gateway forwards to Ollama), so Open WebUI / OpenClaw pickers do not show duplicate HF models.

- **Model Gateway:** Stopped appending placeholder `claude-sonnet-*` model ids to `GET /v1/models` whenever `CLAUDE_CODE_LOCAL_MODEL` was set — they polluted Open WebUI / OpenClaw “active models.” Remapping in `/v1/messages` is unchanged. Opt back in with **`CLAUDE_CODE_ADVERTISE_ALIASES=1`** in `.env` if a client strictly validates the model list.

- **Docs — MCP hardening + OpenClaw operations:** [`mcp/docs/openclaw-hardening-and-operations.md`](mcp/docs/openclaw-hardening-and-operations.md) — defense-in-depth vs forked bridge; two-layer model (MCP gateway vs dashboard/ops-controller); ComfyUI workflows/models/nodes/monitoring; optional future “dashboard MCP adapter.”

- **MCP module layout:** Gateway templates (`gateway-wrapper.sh`, `registry-custom.yaml`) moved under **`mcp/gateway/`**; ComfyUI/OpenClaw architecture doc moved to **`mcp/docs/comfyui-openclaw.md`** (`docs/architecture/comfyui-openclaw-mcp.md` is a redirect). **`openclaw/openclaw.json.example`** documents **`plugins.entries.openclaw-mcp-bridge`** with a single **`servers.gateway`** URL for the Docker MCP Gateway.

- **Docs — automated social/video pipeline:** [`docs/architecture/automated-social-content-pipeline.md`](docs/architecture/automated-social-content-pipeline.md) — target end state (generate → normalize → publish → observe) and how OpenClaw, MCP, ComfyUI, n8n, and the dashboard fit together.

- **Docs — OpenClaw ↔ ComfyUI vs n8n (merged):** [`docs/architecture/comfyui-openclaw-mcp.md`](docs/architecture/comfyui-openclaw-mcp.md) — reliability (`gateway__call`, flat tools), n8n-style parity matrix, optional ComfyUI-OpenClaw note. Supersedes the split **`mcp-comfyui-reliability`** / **`openclaw-comfyui-n8n-parity`** docs. **`TOOLS.md`** / **`comfyui-assets.md`** updated so agents treat ComfyUI like n8n through the **same MCP gateway**.

- **ComfyUI — local Primus workflows:** [`data/comfyui-workflows/local-primus-replacements/`](data/comfyui-workflows/local-primus-replacements/) — checkpoint-only T2I (`primus_ai_image_local_flux.json`, `PARAM_*` for MCP) and LTX notes (`primus_local_video_ltx_notes.txt`). Docs/agent notes emphasize **local checkpoints** first; Juno pack README rewritten **local-first**. Mirror JSON under [`workflow-templates/comfyui-workflows/local-primus-replacements/`](workflow-templates/comfyui-workflows/local-primus-replacements/).

- **ComfyUI MCP — stack management tools:** **`comfyui-mcp/tools/management.py`** registers **`install_custom_node_requirements`** and **`restart_comfyui`** (HTTP to ops-controller). **`comfyui-mcp/Dockerfile`** patches upstream **`server.py`** to load them. **`docker-compose`** passes **`OPS_CONTROLLER_URL`** / **`OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN`** into **`comfyui-mcp`** and **`mcp-gateway`**. **`mcp/registry-custom.yaml`** + **`gateway-wrapper.sh`** substitute **`PLACEHOLDER_OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN`** at gateway startup for spawned ComfyUI MCP containers. **TOOLS.md** / **comfyui-assets** / **TROUBLESHOOTING** document **`gateway__call`** + inner tool names (same paradigm as n8n).

- **Dashboard + ops-controller — ComfyUI `pip` from OpenClaw:** **`POST /api/comfyui/install-node-requirements`** (JSON **`node_path`**, **`confirm`**) proxies to ops-controller, which runs **`python3 -m pip install -r`** inside the **`comfyui`** container (Docker API). OpenClaw can manage custom-node Python deps using **`DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN`** + **`wget`/`exec`**, no Docker socket on the gateway. Requires **`OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN`**. **`docs/audit/SCHEMA.md`** documents audit action **`comfyui_pip_install`**.

- **ComfyUI asset orchestration:** **`openclaw/workspace/agents/comfyui-assets.md`** — paths (shared `custom_nodes`), what the gateway cannot do (Docker, `pip` in the ComfyUI venv), Dashboard restarts, LiteLLM/`localhost` caveats, cron cleanup. Host scripts **`scripts/comfyui/install_node_requirements.sh`** / **`.ps1`** run **`docker compose exec comfyui python3 -m pip install -r ...`** for a node pack. **`TOOLS.md.example`**, **`AGENTS.md.example`**, **`docker-ops.md`**, **`TROUBLESHOOTING`**, and **`openclaw/README.md`** updated to point agents at this flow instead of looping on **`docker`** errors inside the gateway.

- **OpenClaw MCP bridge fork:** [`openclaw/extensions/openclaw-mcp-bridge/`](openclaw/extensions/openclaw-mcp-bridge/README-ORDO-AI-STACK.md) (based on npm `openclaw-mcp-bridge@0.2.0`) registers **each namespaced MCP tool** as a first-class OpenClaw tool (e.g. `gateway__duckduckgo__search`), not only `gateway__call`. `openclaw-plugin-config` installs from the repo fork when mounted at `/fork-openclaw-mcp-bridge`. After pulling, run `docker compose run --rm openclaw-plugin-config` then restart `openclaw-gateway`.
- **`ordo-ai-stack initialize`:** Single entry (`./ordo-ai-stack`, `.\ordo-ai-stack.ps1`, or `.\ordo-ai-stack.cmd`) runs `ensure_dirs`, OpenClaw workspace seeding, then `docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate` from the repo root (set `BASE_PATH` or run from the install directory). **`openclaw/scripts/ensure_openclaw_workspace.sh`** added for Linux/Mac parity with the PowerShell script. **`data/qdrant`** is created by `ensure_dirs` for the RAG profile volume.
- **OpenClaw channel secrets:** `merge_gateway_config.py` rewrites Discord and Telegram bot tokens to OpenClaw SecretRef form when `DISCORD_TOKEN` / `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` or `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is set in `.env`, so tokens need not live as plaintext in `openclaw.json`. `openclaw-gateway` receives `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` from the environment.
- **Housekeeping:** This changelog; PRD milestone updates for M6 (partial, non-auth) and resolved open questions where features already exist (CI, audit rotation, M7 spine).

- **OpenClaw gateway (official image):** Compose no longer passes **`gateway`** as the only command (Docker’s **`node`** entrypoint treated it as **`/app/gateway`** and crashed with **`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`**). **`openclaw-gateway`** and **`openclaw-plugin-install`** now run **`node /app/dist/index.js …`** like [upstream `docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/blob/main/docker-compose.yml).

- **openclaw-mcp-bridge (fork):** **`registerFlatMcpTools`** no longer marks registration “done” when **zero** MCP tools were discovered (e.g. **mcp-gateway** still starting). Retries on **`session_start`** up to **12** attempts, then logs and stops. Reduces **`Tool not found` for `gateway__comfyui__run_workflow`** when flat tools never registered.

- **OpenClaw Docker image:** Default compose image is now the official **`ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:2026.3.23`** ([release](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/releases/tag/v2026.3.23), [package](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pkgs/container/openclaw)) instead of **`ghcr.io/phioranex/openclaw-docker:latest`**. Override with **`OPENCLAW_IMAGE`** in `.env`.

- **Docs — architecture:** Index at [`docs/architecture/README.md`](docs/architecture/README.md). Removed **`mcp-comfyui-reliability.md`** and **`openclaw-comfyui-n8n-parity.md`** in favor of **`comfyui-openclaw-mcp.md`** — why the stack feels brittle, **`gateway__call`** vs flat tools, Dashboard/n8n alternatives, and the parity matrix.

- **MCP — ComfyUI via gateway only:** Dashboard **`MCP_GATEWAY_SERVERS`** default in **`docker-compose.yml`** now includes **`comfyui`** (with duckduckgo, n8n, playwright) so new installs do not seed **`servers.txt`** with DuckDuckGo-only. **`openclaw-gateway`** no longer **`depends_on`** **`comfyui-mcp`** — OpenClaw uses **`http://mcp-gateway:8811/mcp`** only. **`TOOLS.md`** / **`.example`**, **`TROUBLESHOOTING`**, **`mcp/README.md`**, **`docs/docker-runtime.md`**, **`comfyui-assets.md`**: document valid **`gateway__comfyui__*`** tool names; **`gateway__run_workflow`** is invalid.

- **Primus local workflows:** [`local-primus-replacements/README.md`](data/comfyui-workflows/local-primus-replacements/README.md) and [`primus_local_video_ltx_notes.txt`](data/comfyui-workflows/local-primus-replacements/primus_local_video_ltx_notes.txt) drop cloud-model framing; removed `primus_veo3_video_local_ltx_placeholder.txt`. Juno pack [`README.md`](data/comfyui-workflows/juno-comfyui-workflows-main/juno-comfyui-workflows-main/README.md) leads with **local-first** paths. **`TOOLS.md`** / **`AGENTS.md`** (and **`.example`**) + **`comfyui-assets.md`** use **checkpoint vs proxy** language without naming non-local products.

- **OpenClaw workspace:** **`AGENTS.md`**, **`TOOLS.md`**, **`workspace/agents/comfyui-assets.md`** (and **`.example`** templates) distinguish **checkpoint pulls** (`models/`) from **proxy-only** Juno graphs — avoids bogus “model download” heartbeats for HTTP-only paths. **`local-primus-replacements/README.md`** is **local-first** (checkpoints only).

- **ComfyUI MCP `workflow_manager`:** Skips UI/editor workflow exports and ignores non-dict top-level keys when scanning `*.json`, so stray metadata files (e.g. `id`/`name` stubs) or Juno UI JSON under `data/comfyui-workflows/` no longer crash server startup.

- **OpenClaw MCP:** `openclaw-mcp-bridge` uses **one** URL — the Docker **MCP gateway** (`http://mcp-gateway:8811/mcp`). ComfyUI tools are aggregated there; do not add a second `comfyui` server URL. `merge_gateway_config.py` / `add_mcp_plugin_config.py` **remove** a legacy `servers.comfyui` entry if present. **TOOLS.md** / **AGENTS** / **TROUBLESHOOTING** document **`gateway__call`** (and flat **`gateway__comfyui__*`** tools) instead of **`comfyui__call`**.
- **ComfyUI MCP:** `workflow_manager` discovers **`*.json`** recursively under `data/comfyui-workflows/`; **`workflow_id`** may be a **nested POSIX path** (no `.json` suffix). **UI-format** workflow exports are rejected with a clear error; **`/prompt`** requires **API-format** JSON. **TROUBLESHOOTING** documents **`gateway__call`** + **`tool: "run_workflow"`** vs wrong **`gateway__comfyui__run_workflow`** flat tool ids, FL2V vs T2V, and API export.
- **OpenClaw ↔ ComfyUI custom nodes:** `openclaw-gateway` bind-mounts **`data/comfyui-storage/ComfyUI/custom_nodes`** to **`workspace/comfyui-custom-nodes/`** so agents install LTX/Juno/etc. in the same tree the **`comfyui`** service uses (not `/app/ComfyUI` in the gateway image). **`ensure_dirs`** creates the host path; **`TOOLS.md`**, **`AGENTS`**, **`docker-ops.md`**, **`TROUBLESHOOTING`**, **`docs/docker-runtime.md`** updated.
- **OpenClaw workspace:** **`TOOLS.md.example`** and `data/openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md` rewritten as a **short canonical** contract (MCP, cron+Discord, failure table); long ComfyUI/dashboard runbooks deferred to **`workspace/agents/docker-ops.md`** and **TROUBLESHOOTING**. **`AGENTS.md.example`** and `data/openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md` gain a **Non-negotiables** section at the top (tool names, Discord source-of-truth, 2000-char limit). **`openclaw/README.md`** and **`docs/configuration.md`** workspace tables updated.
- **Docs:** [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/runbooks/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) adds **OpenClaw cron + Discord** (`not-delivered` vs real Discord failures, `Message failed`, `channel:` recipient); [openclaw/README.md](openclaw/README.md) links to it.
- **Docs:** `docs/docker-runtime.md` OpenClaw dependency table corrected (removed non-existent `openclaw-merge-config` / `openclaw-ensure-workspace`); `docs/configuration.md` adds **Re-run OpenClaw sync** with real compose service names + Windows Git Bash `docker exec` note; `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` quick diagnostics adds the same MSYS path pitfall.
- **OpenClaw AGENTS / MCP tool names:** Verified that **`Tool not found`** for `gateway__duckduckgo__search`, `gateway__n8n__workflow_list`, etc. matches **invalid top-level ids** (upstream registers only **`gateway__call`** per MCP server; this fork also registers flat **`gateway__*__*`** tools), not a missing DuckDuckGo server when **`servers.txt`** lists **`duckduckgo`**. Long **`data/openclaw/workspace/AGENTS.md`** had misleading **`gateway__n8n_*`**-style bullets before OpenClaw’s **~20 k** bootstrap truncation and omitted the explicit wrong-name warning; local AGENTS wording updated; **`TROUBLESHOOTING.md`** documents truncation + **`gateway__n8n__workflow_list`**.
- **OpenClaw native web search:** `openclaw.json.example` and the default data config set **`tools.web.search.enabled: false`** so agents use MCP **`gateway__call` + `duckduckgo__search`** only; **AGENTS.md.example**, **TOOLS.md.example**, **TROUBLESHOOTING**, and **`.env.example`** updated accordingly.
- **OpenClaw workspace permissions:** `openclaw-workspace-sync` now runs **`chown -R 1000:1000`** on the workspace bind mount after seeding so **`MEMORY.md`** and other files are writable by **`node`** (fixes `EACCES` when copies were root-owned). Docs: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `TOOLS.md.example` §H, `openclaw/README.md`; helper scripts `scripts/fix_openclaw_workspace_permissions.ps1` and `.sh`.
- **TOOLS.md stub upgrade:** `openclaw-workspace-sync`, `ensure_openclaw_workspace` scripts, and `fix_openclaw_workspace_permissions` replace a stale short **`TOOLS.md`** with **`TOOLS.md.example`** when the contract marker is missing (opt out: **`OPENCLAW_SKIP_TOOLS_MD_UPGRADE=1`**). Scripts: `openclaw/scripts/workspace_sync_upgrade_tools.sh` (container), `upgrade_tools_md_from_example.ps1` / `.sh` (host).
- **OpenClaw / MCP:** `TOOLS.md.example` adds a **CRITICAL** section (invalid `gateway__*` top-level names, Brave vs DuckDuckGo, why bare `curl`/`GET` to `/mcp` fails); §H adds a matching row. `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` documents these under OpenClaw and avoids implying a plain `curl` to `:8811/mcp` is a valid health probe. Operators with an old short `data/openclaw/workspace/TOOLS.md` should replace it from the template (sync is copy-if-missing).
- **Documentation:** `SECURITY_HARDENING.md` §11 and `.env.example` describe channel SecretRef behavior and Telegram env wiring.
- **OpenClaw docs:** `openclaw/README.md`, `openclaw/OPENCLAW_SECURE.md`, and `openclaw/OPENCLAW_SECURE.md.example` updated for Discord/Telegram `.env` + `merge_gateway_config.py` SecretRef flow.
- **OpenClaw workspace:** Layered `SOUL.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `TOOLS.md` (policy vs environment contract); expanded `TOOLS.md` runbook; optional `USER.md.example`, `IDENTITY.md.example`, `HEARTBEAT.md.example`; `MEMORY.md` guidance; `openclaw-workspace-sync` now copies workspace `*.md` **only when missing** in `data/` (still refreshes `health_check.sh` and `agents/`); `ensure_openclaw_workspace.ps1` seeds the additional files.
- **Git:** Top-level `openclaw/workspace/*.md` (non-example) are gitignored; templates remain as `*.md.example`. Tracked copies of `SOUL.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `TOOLS.md` / `MEMORY.md` were removed from the index (files stay on disk locally).
- **OpenClaw Discord SecretRef:** `merge_gateway_config.py` now emits `provider: "default"` in env SecretRefs (required by OpenClaw 2026.3.x); omitting it caused `channels.discord.token: Invalid input` and prevented the gateway (and Discord) from starting.
- **Docs:** `SECURITY_HARDENING.md` §11, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` (OpenClaw → Discord/SecretRef), `.env.example`, `SECURITY.md`, and `openclaw/README.md` document the full SecretRef shape and recovery steps.
