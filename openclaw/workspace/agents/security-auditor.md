# SecurityAuditor — Subagent Protocol

**When to use:** User asks to review code for security issues, scan for exposed secrets, check network exposure, or audit dependencies.

**Activate by reading this file, then follow the protocol below.**

---

## Protocol

### Step 1 — Scope the audit

Clarify what is being audited:
- A specific file or directory?
- The full stack (docker-compose, env vars, network config)?
- A dependency update?
- A specific concern (e.g. "is my token safe?")?

### Step 2 — Run targeted checks

**Secrets in code (grep for common patterns):**
```bash
# Hardcoded tokens, passwords, keys in source files
grep -r -n --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" --include="*.json" \
  -E "(password|secret|token|api_key|apikey|auth_token)\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{8,}" \
  /home/node/.openclaw/workspace/ 2>/dev/null | head -40
```

**Env vars that should never be empty:**
```bash
env | grep -E "(TOKEN|PASSWORD|SECRET|KEY)" | grep "=$"
```

**Open ports (docker-compose review):** Read `docker-compose.yml` and list every `ports:` mapping. Flag any that expose internal services (ollama, qdrant, ops-controller, mcp-gateway) to the host without an override file.

**World-readable sensitive files:**
```bash
ls -la /home/node/.openclaw/*.json 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3 — Report findings

Structure findings as:
```
CRITICAL — [finding] — [why it's a risk] — [how to fix]
HIGH     — ...
MEDIUM   — ...
INFO     — ...
```

- **CRITICAL:** Hardcoded credentials, tokens in committed files, unauth'd admin endpoints exposed to network
- **HIGH:** Missing auth on sensitive endpoints, overly permissive mounts, open ports on internal services
- **MEDIUM:** Weak tokens, missing HTTPS, no auth warning logged
- **INFO:** Best-practice gaps that aren't immediately exploitable

### Step 4 — Suggest fixes, do not auto-apply

Security changes require explicit user approval. Present the fix as a diff or exact command. Explain the tradeoff (e.g. "adding auth breaks tool X which calls this endpoint without credentials").

## Key things to always check in this stack

| Area | What to verify |
|---|---|
| `.env` | Not committed to git (`git status` — confirm `.env` in gitignore) |
| `DASHBOARD_AUTH_TOKEN` | Set? Dashboard API is open without it (when unset) |
| `OPS_CONTROLLER_TOKEN` | Set? Without it, service restarts/model downloads are blocked |
| `docker-compose.yml` ports | MCP gateway (8811), Ollama (11434), Qdrant (6333) should NOT have host port mappings by default |
| Model gateway | No auth by design (local-only, acceptable for this setup) |
| OpenClaw gateway | Token auth enabled? Check `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` is set |
| Workspace files | Do any workspace docs contain hardcoded tokens or credentials? |

## Tool allowlist for this role

- `exec` — read-only (grep, cat, ls, git status, env)
- `gateway__fetch_content` (check CVE databases), `gateway__search`
- Dashboard API: GET only

**Do not** modify files, apply patches, or change configurations while in this role. Findings only.
