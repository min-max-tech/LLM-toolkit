# On Windows (Docker Desktop), the DOCKER-USER iptables chain is not directly

SSRF egress blocking (Windows / Docker Desktop)
==============================================

Docker Desktop on Windows does not expose the DOCKER-USER iptables chain from
the host. Options:

1. WSL2: If you run Docker via WSL2, run the Linux script from inside WSL:
   wsl -e bash -c 'cd /mnt/f/LLM-toolkit && ./scripts/ssrf-egress-block.sh --dry-run'
   Then apply from a WSL shell with sudo.

2. Docker Desktop network policies: Enterprise feature; see Docker docs.

3. Accept default posture: For local-only use, the risk is lower; ensure
   MCP tools are from trusted sources and only enable what you need.
